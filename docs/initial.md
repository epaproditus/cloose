Using Clippy as an Interface for Goose While Keeping Goose Intact
You're absolutely right that we can keep Goose mostly intact while using Clippy's interface. This approach is actually more feasible than rebuilding Clippy to work with MCP, and it would preserve all of Goose's functionality.

Why This Approach Makes Sense (Feasibility: 8/10)
From analyzing both applications, it's clear that Electron applications are inherently modular with good separation between their UI and backend logic. Since both applications use modern JavaScript/TypeScript, integration is quite feasible.

How to Preserve Goose While Using Clippy's Interface
1. Keep Goose's Core MCP Client Logic Completely Intact
Preserve all MCP protocol handling, server connections, and core functionality
Maintain Goose's existing configuration and settings
Don't modify any of Goose's backend code that handles communication with MCP servers
2. Use Clippy for Its Interface Elements Only
Utilize Clippy's character, animations, and chat interface
Preserve the nostalgic design and interaction patterns
Keep Clippy's UI component structure and animation system
3. Create a Thin Adapter Layer
The key to success would be a lightweight adapter that would:

Connect Clippy's UI events (like chat messages) to Goose's MCP client functionality
Translate responses from Goose's MCP client into a format Clippy's UI can display
Handle any formatting differences between the two systems
4. Minimal Modifications
Replace Clippy's @electron/llm interactions with calls to Goose's MCP client
Extend Clippy's settings UI to include Goose's MCP-specific configurations
Keep both codebases mostly separate, connected only through well-defined interfaces
The Main Advantages
Goose stays intact: All the core MCP functionality remains unchanged
Minimal code changes: Focus only on the UI layer and integration points
Better user experience: Users get Clippy's nostalgic interface with Goose's powerful MCP capabilities
Maintainability: Updates to either application can be incorporated more easily
Potential Challenges
The main complexities would be:

Understanding Goose's API boundaries
Building the right adapter between the two systems
Ensuring configuration flows correctly between components
