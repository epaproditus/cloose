# Project Guidelines

## Documentation Requirements

-   Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
-   Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
-   Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md

## Architecture Decision Records

Create ADRs in /docs/adr for:

-   Major dependency changes
-   Architectural pattern changes
-   New integration patterns
-   Database schema changes

## Memory and Confidence Checks
- Before and after any tool use, give me a confidence level (0-10) on how the tool use will help the project.

## Code Quality
-   ensure the code is complete
-   Try to keep files at a maximum of 400 lines when possible. 

## Assumptions Check
-  List all assumptions and uncertainties you need to clear up before completing this task.

## Thoughtful Development

- Before starting, use the sequentialthinking tool. You can decide the number of iterations unless otherwise told. 
- Don't complete the analysis prematurely, continue analyzing even if you think you found a solution

- Rate confidence (1-10) before saving files, after saving, after rejections, and before task completion
